      <h1>What is Free (no asterisk)?</h1>
      <p>
        If you are a digital content creator, or are thinking about creating
        digital content, you may have started looking into some software
        solutions that you might use to create your content. There is a wide
        variety of content creation programs available, some free, and some
        quite expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are just starting out and are low on capital, you might want to
        start out creating content using free software. In this case, you are at
        the right place, because I want to show you how to choose the right
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some software programs advertise themselves to be free to use, only to
        hit you with a paywall to use an essential feature. For example, a
        software to edit videos might advertise itself to be free to use, only
        for you to realise after you started using it that for commercial use,
        your video needs to carry the watermark of the software. This is an
        example of a free* software, where free is followed by an asterisk and
        the software isn't actually free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free (no asterisk) is a website that aims to showcase free content
        creation software that can be used comercially with no restrictions. We
        look at 2D animation, 3D animation, video editing and photo editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will mostly be looking at open source software. Open source software
        is surprisingly feature rich, but sometimes the features feel slightly
        more clunky than industry standard programs. These solutions therefore
        often have slightly steeper learning curves, but almost always have the
        same feature sets as their paid counterparts.
      </p>
      <h2>How to choose free content creation software</h2>
      <p>
        If perhaps there is a type of content not covered on this website, or
        you just wish to start searching for software yourself, you can follow
        these tips to make sure your software is free to use commercially with
        no restrictions.
      </p>
      <!--Giving the class of standard list to make it similar to paragraph text.-->
      <ul class="standard-list">
        <li>
          Choose open source software. If you look for open source software
          instead of free software, you are more likely to get software that can
          be used comercially.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read up on the software before you commit. You don't want to hit a
          paywall when it is too late and you have spent too much time on a
          project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't give up on an open source software too soon. They are often
          feature rich and have good support online in forums.
        </li>
      </ul>
