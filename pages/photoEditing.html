      <h3>About GIMP</h3>
      <p>
        GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free and open-source image
        editing software that can be used for a range of tasks such as photo
        retouching, image composition, and graphic design. It is available for
        Windows, Mac OS, and Linux operating systems.

        Here is a table comparing some of the key features of GIMP with a
        premium image editing software, Adobe Photoshop:

      <p>
        While Adobe Photoshop is considered the industry standard for
        professional image editing, GIMP offers many of the same features for
        free. GIMP includes layers, selection tools, filters and effects, and
        retouching tools such as the clone stamp and healing brush. However,
        Adobe Photoshop includes more advanced features such as support for
        vector graphics and more extensive plug-in and extension support.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of pricing, GIMP is completely free, while Adobe Photoshop
        requires a subscription. While GIMP may have a steeper learning curve
        than Adobe Photoshop, there are many online resources available to help
        users get started. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on
        the specific needs of the user and the project at hand.
