      <h3>About OpenToonz</h3>
      <p>
        OpenToonz is a free and open-source 2D animation software that was
        originally developed by Studio Ghibli in Japan. It was later released to
        the public and has been continuously updated and maintained by the
        open-source community. OpenToonz is a powerful tool for creating
        traditional hand-drawn animations, as well as digital animations using
        vector graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the key features of OpenToonz include a versatile drawing and
        painting toolset, a range of timeline and animation features, support
        for multiple file formats, and the ability to work with a variety of
        animation techniques, including cut-out animation, frame-by-frame
        animation, and morphing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to its core features, OpenToonz also offers a range of
        plugins and extensions that can be used to enhance its functionality,
        such as the ability to import and export SVG files, create complex
        particle effects, and add advanced color correction tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a table comparing some of the key features of OpenToonz with a
        premium animation software, Adobe Animate:

        features, OpenToonz is a highly capable animation software that offers a
        lot of functionality for free. It's a great option for those who want to
        get started with animation without investing in a premium software.
